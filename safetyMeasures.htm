            <p>Have you ever felt frightened or intimidated when out walking alone? Have you ever wondered what you should do if approached by an attacker? Have you ever worried about becoming yet another home invasion statistic?</p>
            <p>The following points are eighteen things that every woman should know about personal safety:</p>

            <h4>1. Always, always be aware of your surroundings</h4>
            <p>The worst thing you can do is have no idea who or what is around you. The more you pay attention, the less likely you are to be surprised.</p>

            </div>

            <h4>2. Limit your distractions</h4>
            <p>If you’re walking through a deserted parking lot, is it really necessary to send a text right that moment? If you’re focused solely on your phone and checking your email, you’re not going to notice if something, or someone, looks out of place.</p>

            </div>

            <h4>3. Make eye contact</h4>
            <p>The best thing you can do is let others know that you see them and could identify them if need be. When you pass someone on the street, look them in the eye and give a polite nod of the head to acknowledge you see them very clearly.</p>

            <h4>4. Walk with purpose</h4>
            <p>Stand tall and keep your posture so that it represents authority. The less you look like a victim, the less likely someone will target you as such. So, pull your shoulders back, keep your back straight and your stomach in and walk in a way that lets the world know that you will not go down without a fight.</p>

            <h4>5. If you see something suspicious, report it</h4>
            <p>Don’t worry about whether you’re overreacting or being overcautious. If you think something is out of place, make a call to the authorities. It’s always better to be safe than sorry. That’s what the police are there for. It’s better all the way around if they can be proactive instead of reactive.</p>

            <h4>6. If you have to defend yourself, aim for body parts on your attacker that are tender and cannot be strengthened</h4>
            <p>If you find yourself in a position where you have to defend yourself, you want to aim wherever it’s going to hurt the most regardless of the attacker’s strength and size. These areas are the eyes, nose, throat, groin and shin. You can’t toughen them up so it doesn’t matter if he’s twice your size; hit him in one of these spots and he’s going to feel some pain.</p>

            <h4>7. Set boundaries and enforce them</h4>
            <p>If someone comes too close for comfort, tell them and force them to move back and give you your space. Don’t worry about whether you’ll come across as short or impolite. If your safety is at stake, it’s no time to be nice</p>

            <h4>8. If someone tries to force you to a different location, do not go</h4>
            <p>Research has shown over and over again that if someone intends to move you, they also intend for you to not make it out alive. Whatever you do, never get in a vehicle with someone regardless of what they tell you because it isn’t going to be good.</p>

            <h4>9. Don’t open your house door without knowing who is on the other side</h4>
            <p>Even if it’s someone who claims to be from the electric company, if you’re not expecting them then make them wait while you call yourself and verify their identity. The minute you open your door, that person has access not only to your home, but to you and your family as well.</p>

            <h4>10. Watch your use of social media</h4>
            <p>Some people put everything on Facebook, from what they ate to how they did their hair today. Remember that the more information you give out, the more someone else will know your schedule and can figure out when you’re most vulnerable.</p>

            <h4>11. Take a self-defense class</h4>
            <p>You can never know too much when it comes to defending yourself or your family from someone who has bad intentions. Take the time to learn new ways to fend off an attacker and make sure you practice them regularly.</p>

            <h4>12. Trust your gut</h4>
            <p>If you feel like something is out of place, trust your instinct. Your sixth sense is actually your mind picking up on miniscule things that your brain doesn’t exactly register. So, if the hair on the back of your neck starts to raise, pay attention because something isn’t right.</p>

            <h4>13. Carry a weapon only if you’re trained and willing to use it</h4>
            <p>Some women choose to carry pepper spray or a firearm as a method of defense. While that’s fine, make sure that you know how to use your weapon of choice properly and effectively. Also, don’t carry anything if you’re not willing to use it because then it just becomes something that the bad guy can take and use against you.</p>

            <h4>14. Never walk alone</h4>
            <p>Especially at night. If it can’t be helped, take all possible precautions to ensure your safety. Keep your phone out of sight and refrain from listening to music, as you won’t be able to hear someone approaching you from behind.</p>

            <h4>15. Scream at the top of your lungs</h4>
            <p>And twist your arm up and down if someone tries to grab you. Do anything you can to draw as much attention to yourself as possible.</p>


            <h4>16. Never trust a stranger</h4>
            <p>Based on his appearance. Most offenders don’t even look like criminals but your friendly next door neighbour, and are sometimes dressed quite well.</p>

            <h4>17. Be mindful of the way you dress</h4>
            <p>Especially if you will be walking alone. Shoes like wedges and high heels, and tight skirts, will be hard to run in while scarves and long necklaces are easy to grab. Play a scenario through your mind and try to determine if you would be able to easily defend yourself with what you’re wearing.</p>

            <h4>18. Never, ever give up!</h4>
            <p>No matter what happens, never stop fighting. Unleash your inner bitch and let her go. If you’re in a fight for your life, make sure you’re the one who wins. It’s time to play dirty and let the cards fall where they may. Also, realize that even if you’re injured (which you most likely would be in a self-defense situation), it doesn’t mean it’s a critical injury. Just keep fighting and have faith that you will persevere.</p>
