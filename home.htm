                        <p>Mike, a former police detective with the Philadelphia Police Department, has been working as the
                            police liaison for Women Against Abuse, so that he can help survivors in ways he couldn’t as a
                            detective.</p>
                        <p>Even though the job comes with some tough challenges, Mike continues to love every day of work.
                            “Working with some really strong
                            people and seeing the problems they face every day and being able to help them get through it
                            and match them with the service they need. That’s the best thing,” said Mike. “To see the
                            resilience when they come to you, they give you strength. Our clients give us strength to go
                            forward.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In June 2018, Mike was honored with the Excellence in Male Leadership Award by the Pennsylvania
                            Coalition Against Domestic Violence as part of their Father's Day campaign. Mike received the
                            award at the Philadelphia Phillies' annual Domestic Violence Awareness game, where he threw out
                            the first pitch.</p>

                        <p>Nearly a decade ago I worked on a special public relations project while at the Philadelphia Bar
                            Association with Molly Callahan – working to get the
                            word out about a training program for lawyers to help the Women Against Abuse legal clinic. A
                            short time later I had moved to Dechert, but Molly remembered my work when a client’s child was
                            abducted and called to ask if I could help get a press conference set up. We were able to get
                            all the local TV stations, radio outlets to an event where the child’s mother,
                            Women Against Abuse officials and the police told the story. Happily, the child was found within
                            a few days.</p>
                        <p>I asked Molly what more I could do and she told me the holiday drive was in desperate need of
                            donations. A few years later when Dechert was looking for a holiday charity, I happily suggested
                            Women Against Abuse and we’ve been
                            successful partners ever since.</p>
